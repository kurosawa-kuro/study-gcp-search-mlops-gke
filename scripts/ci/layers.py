"""AST-based layer boundary checker (MLOps skeleton edition).

Walks every Port / pure-logic module and reports any forbidden import
(concrete adapter, GCP SDK, LightGBM where inapplicable). Each file
is inspected at *every* `Import` / `ImportFrom` node — top-level AND
inside functions — so lazy imports cannot smuggle a banned dependency
back in.

Two consumers share the canonical ruleset declared here:

- ``tests/unit/arch/test_import_boundaries.py`` imports ``RULES``,
  ``DIRECTORY_RULES``, ``UNIVERSAL_BANS``, and ``find_violations()`` so
  pytest cases stay aligned with this script.
- ``make check-layers`` runs ``python -m scripts.ci.layers`` for ad-hoc
  inspection outside pytest. Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = violations found,
  with ``<rel_path>:<line>`` references for every offending import.

Phase F-2 added auto-discovery: instead of (or in addition to) listing
every file in ``RULES``, callers can declare a ``DIRECTORY_RULES``
entry that applies to every ``.py`` under that directory subtree. Files
not covered by either ``RULES`` or ``DIRECTORY_RULES`` are unrestricted
(only ``UNIVERSAL_BANS`` apply). To add a per-file override that
diverges from the directory default, add it to ``RULES`` — file-level
rules win.
